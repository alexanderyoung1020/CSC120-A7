Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

For the Cafe class, I overloaded sellCoffee() so there was one method to handle int values (default) and another to handle float values. I also included an overloaded that has all of the other parameters except nSugarPackets to demonstrate a cafe that ran out of sugar. For the House class, I overloaded two constructors, one that lacks an address parameter and another that lacks a nFloors parameter. For the Library class, I overloaded two constructors, one that has an additonal int parameter for nStudySpaces, and another that has additonal parameter, but as a String for a special collection that the library has. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

For this assignment, you should have a working knowledge of inheritance that you can "extend" to the concepts of method overriding and method overloading. The sequence of A6 and A7 taught me about polymorphism and the parent/child relationship between classes. After creating multiple buildings from smith campus, I now understand how to create multiple instances of in a class by using its subclasses to create a functional map.
